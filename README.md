# CUBO Chess AI Web App

CUBO Chess is a full-stack chess application built with a focus on clean design, intuitive interaction, and an intelligent AI opponent.
This project integrates a Flask-based backend, a modern JavaScript frontend, and a handcrafted AI engine using Minimax with evaluation heuristics.

A great demonstration of practical AI integration, UI/UX design, and full-stack deployment.

## Key Features

* Three AI difficulty levels: Easy (random), Medium (strategic), Hard (deep evaluation)
* Smart AI engine using Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning
* Piece-square table evaluation for positional awareness
* Move highlights with sound feedback
* Captured pieces display for both players
* Move history tracking (PGN-style)
* Mistake learning: AI avoids repeating fatal moves
* Responsive UI: Mobile-friendly, clean layout

## AI Engine

The core of the bot is a customized Minimax implementation with:

* Material scoring
* Positional heuristics (piece-square tables)
* Center control bias
* Opening book for early-game strength
* Checkmate memory — logs losing moves and avoids them in future games
